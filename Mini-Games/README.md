# Mini Games

I created many games with the [main.py](main.py) as the entry point to the multiple games i created. The first game i created was [Guess the Number](GNT.py). I then explored importing other python files into one. I created [Rock Paper Scissors](RPS.py) and imported it. Following with [Wordle](Wordle.py), [ConnectFour](ConnectFour.py) and [Tic Tac Toe](TTT.py)
