# Mini Games

I created many games with the [main.py](main.py) as the entry point to the multiple games i created. 


| Game | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Guess the Number](GNT.py) | The first game I created which explores user inputs for guessing a random number |
| [Rock Paper Scissors](RPS.py) | This explores user inputs with strings and comparing them to create the common Rock Paper Scissors Game |
| [Wordle](Wordle.py) | Uses user inputs to determine if the word is correct or if the letters of an input are in the word but in the correct/wrong place or not at all  |
| [ConnectFour](ConnectFour.py) | Uses user inputs to place a character in a connect four grid which you are then challenged to play against a friend as there is an implemented turn system  |
| [Tic Tac Toe](TTT.py) | Uses user inputs to play Tic Tac Toe against the computer |
